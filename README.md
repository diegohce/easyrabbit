# easyrabbit

This Go package is a simplified encapsulation of [streadway/amqp package](https://github.com/streadway/amqp) for most common uses such as simple publishing and consuming messages from rabbitmq-server. It is in a "work in progress" status yet so, stay tuned!

# Examples

For a working example, please check [raas](https://github.com/diegohce/raas) (rabbitmq as a service)
